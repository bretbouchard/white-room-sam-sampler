# Local SoundFont Files

This directory contains SoundFont (`.sf2`) files for **development testing only**.

## Files

### test_drums.sf2 (9KB)
- **Type**: Minimal test SoundFont with simple sine wave samples
- **Purpose**: Test the SoundFont loading pipeline
- **Created**: Generated by `create_test_sf2.py` script
- **Contents**: Single 440Hz test tone (0.1 seconds)

### create_test_sf2.py
- Python script to generate minimal valid SoundFont files
- Creates simple test tones for pipeline testing
- Usage: `python3 create_test_sf2.py`

## Purpose

These files are **NOT** included in the build to keep plugin size small.

The plugin will automatically try to load SoundFonts from:
1. **Local development** (`sf2_local/test_drums.sf2`) - For testing
2. **Plugin Resources** - For production (when SoundFonts are bundled)
3. **Working directory** - Fallback location

## Production Workflow

When ready to include samples in production builds:

1. **Move SoundFonts to `sf2/` directory:**
   ```bash
   mv sf2_local/your_soundfont.sf2 sf2/
   ```

2. **Update CMakeLists.txt** to bundle samples:
   ```cmake
   # Uncomment the sample bundling code in CMakeLists.txt
   set_target_properties(sam_sampler PROPERTIES
       JUCE_PLUGIN_COPY_DATA_AFTER_BUILD TRUE
   )
   ```

3. **Samples will be copied** to all plugin formats (VST3, AU, AUv3, CLAP, LV2, Standalone)

## Original SoundFont Files

The original 16 SoundFont files in `../sf2/` are Git LFS pointers:
- `Piano_Complete.sf2` (585MB) - NOT pulled from LFS
- 15 drum/percussion SoundFonts - NOT pulled from LFS

**Status**: These files exist as Git LFS pointers but the actual binary data was never uploaded to GitHub LFS.

**Error**: All LFS objects return 404 - "Object does not exist on the server"

## Next Steps

To use real drum samples:

1. **Option A**: Download free SoundFonts from:
   - https://www.polyphone.io/en/soundfonts
   - https://www.zanderjaz.com/downloads/soundfonts/drums/
   - https://archive.org/details/500-soundfonts-full-gm-sets

2. **Option B**: Create custom SoundFonts with samples
   - Use Polyphone SoundFont Editor
   - Export to `.sf2` format
   - Place in this directory for testing

3. **Option C**: Purchase commercial SoundFont libraries
   - VSCO Chamber Orchestra (orchestral)
   - Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra (free)
   - Various drum libraries

## Testing

The test SoundFont (`test_drums.sf2`) is sufficient for:
- ✅ Verifying SF2 loading works
- ✅ Testing sample playback engine
- ✅ Debugging DSP pipeline
- ❌ NOT suitable for production sounds
